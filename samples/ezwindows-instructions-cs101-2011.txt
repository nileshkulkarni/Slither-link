Instructions for installing and using EzWindows package:

1. Download the tar file ezwcs101.tar.gz into your 
   home directory (If the download brings this tar file 
   to any other directory, move or copy it to your 
   home directory. You can check which is your home
   directory by typing the command:   echo $HOME)

2. Go to your home directory, if you are not already there.
   (You can simply use the command: cd)

3. Untar and unzip this file by typing the command
   tar -xvf ezwcs101.tar.gz

4. This will create a directory named 'ezwcs101' inside
   your home directory

5. You can now compile and run your graphics programs 
   using Ezwindows package. However, the normal command
   cannot be used to compile these programs, since they will
   have to be 'linked' to other libraries which are part of 
   the ezwindows package. A shell script named "compile" has been 
   provided in the package (located in the ezcs101 directory)
   This text file must be copied to your working directory, where
   you are creating and compiling your graphics programs.

   Alternately, you can go to the 'samples' subdirectory, where 
   a copy of this script has already been placed, and can run 
   all of your programs there.
 
6. To compile and execute your programs, for example, program s1.cpp
   in the samples subdirectory, use the following commands

   $ ./compile s1   (Note: you should not type s1.cpp)
   $ ./s1           (Note: You should not type ./a.out)
